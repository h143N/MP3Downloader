# hideN's MP3 Downloader
### This is a simple terminal MP3 Downloader solution that is based on the `yt-dlp` repository and has a freeze.py file with `py2exe` build instructions. The program creates all the needed files but you still need to download FFmpeg for everything to work.

### Build

Use the `python freeze.py` command.
